#two types of loops
#while and For

#prints hello 5 times, loops start from 0
for i in range(5):
    print(f"hello {i}")

# prints from starting point until end point not including end (2,3,4)
# for i in range(2, 5)

#cna aslo make skips/jumps
#for i in range(0,20,2)

# while loops

#while num < 10:


#loop inerrupts
# break stops the loop entirely
for i in range (5):

    if num ==10:

# continue skips current iteration from the point it is in the loop
